-------------------- FILE MODE ----------------------------
- Make a file system depend seperator for / or \

- check for tar during install
  - List contents like HTML does now

--------------------- SEARCH -----------------------------
- new mode where searching is done on output of 'icat' of allocated
  inodes

- Bug: if the string that matches a keyword starts with spaces, then 
  the 'index' function returns the idx to the start of the spaces and not
  the substring.  (BUG 842858)

--------------------- LOGGING -----------------------------
- New Report Creation:

- Add pulldown in notes for common things:
  - New MD5 / SHA-1
  - Part of rootkit
  - Suspected child porn
  - known child porn

--------------------- SORTER -----------------------------
- Should sorter be at the host level instead of image, with output
files appended to each other?

- Allow one to browse output files

--------------------- GENERAL -----------------------------
- Add foremost
- link in meta data to list just unallocated / used
- Make data bases updatable in the host details view
- Option to mount images in loopback when it is a Linux system
- read config files in autopsy itself and not everytime ...
- Make a way to kill intensive processes (searching, fls)
